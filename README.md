# Age of Arrows

Age of Arrows was my first Big Project. This is a 2-Player Game made entirely in C Programming Language.  
This Program utilizes all the basic knowledge of `arrays`, `structures`, `pointers`, `functions`, `file handling', etc.  
  
This is a game of Archery, where 2 Players control their individual Bows and shoot one another. The game ends when the Players are out of Arrows to shoot.
